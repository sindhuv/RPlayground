All the R Stuff goes here

This is a hodgepodge of some well known algorithms that I tried implementing on my own. Contains:

1. A GoodReads reco system that mainly see how much of a reading buddy that two of your friends in your Goodreads account. (One of these friends can be you). Useful to build recommendations of the next book you might want to pick up from the library.  As on date, Goodreads provides an API to read only your own feed and details. So, the recommendations are extremely skewed, depending on how active your friends are, and how accurate the data provided by them is.
